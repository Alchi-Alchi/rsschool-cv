# *Code example*
* Every book has n pages with page numbers 1 to n. The summary is made by adding up the number of digits of all page numbers.
**Task:** Given the summary, find the number of pages n the book has.
* ***Example:***
If the input is summary=25, then the output must be n=17: The numbers 1 to 17 have 25 digits in total: 1234567891011121314151617.
```
function amountOfPages(summary){
  let n = '';
  let arrOfN = [];
  for (i = 1; i <= summary; i++) {
    n = n + i;
    arrOfN.push (i);
    if (n.length == summary) break;
  }
  return arrOfN.length;
}
amountOfPages(5);
```
